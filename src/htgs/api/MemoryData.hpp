/**
 * @class MemoryData MemoryData.hpp <htgs/api/MemoryData.hpp>
 *
 * @brief Describes memory allocated by a MemoryManager to manage shared memory across multiple ITask.
 * @details
 * Provides mechanisms for allocation, freeing, and memory release strategies associated
 * with memory. Using these mechanisms the MemoryManager can process the memory and recycle it only
 * when the IMemoryReleaseRule indicates it is ready to be released.
 *
 * In order to properly share this data, it should be forwarded along with other IData until the ITask
 * responsible for releasing the data back to its MemoryManager is called.
 *
 * To receive memory from the MemoryManager use ITask::getMemory.
 * To send memory to the MemoryManager use ITask::releaseMemory
 *
 * Use htgs::m_data_t<Type> from <htgs/types/Types.hpp> when handling MemoryData to reduce code size.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 *   ITask::executeTask(std::shared_ptr<Data1> data)
 *   {
 *     ...
 *     // Shared memory getter
 *     // If you don't use m_data_t -> std::shared_ptr<htgs::MemoryData<int>>
 *     htgs::m_data_t<int> readBuffer = this->memGet<int>("readMemory", new ReleaseCountRule(1));
 *     readData(data->getFile(), readBuffer->get());
 *
 *     // Shared memory release example
 *     this->releaseMemory("otherMemory", data->getMemory());
 *
 *     addResult(new Data2(readBuffer));
 *     ...
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example attaching MemoryManager:
 * @code
 * taskGraph->addMemoryManagerEdge("readMemory", readTask, new ReadMemoryAllocator(), readMemoryPoolSize);
 * @endcode
 * @tparam T the type of memory to be held by the MemoryData, this will automatically be converted to a pointer type
