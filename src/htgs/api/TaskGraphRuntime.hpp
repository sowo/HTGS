/**
 * @class TaskGraphRuntime TaskGraphRuntime.hpp <htgs/api/TaskGraphRuntime.hpp>
 * @brief Spawns threads and binds them to the appropriate ITask within a TaskGraph.
 * @details
 *
 * Each thread is bound to a separate ITask instance. If an ITask has more than one thread associated
 * with it, then the Runtime will create a deep copy of the ITask, which is bound to the thread.
 * This means that each thread has a different ITask instance.
 *
 * This process is done for every ITask in the TaskGraph that the Runtime is responsible for.
 *
 * If an ITask is an ExecutionPipeline, then the thread responsible for the ExecutionPipeline will create
 * additional TaskGraphRuntimes, one for each TaskGraph within the ExecutionPipeline.
 *
 * A Runtime can be executed asynchronously with executeRuntime(), allowing for interaction with the main TaskGraph to
 * submit/receive data to/from the TaskGraph.
 *
 * To wait for the Runtime to finish processing all of the data for a TaskGraph, use waitForRuntime(). Be sure to indicate
 * that the input data stream for the graph is closing prior to calling waitForRuntime() (see below).
 *
 * To execute and wait for the Runtime, use executeAndWaitForRuntime(). If data is being produced for the task graph,
 * then the TaskGraph::finishedProducingData function must be called prior to waiting for the runtime
 * in order for the task graph to know that the input to the graph has finished and the tasks processing that input can be notified.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 * htgs::TaskGraphConf<Data1, Data2> *taskGraph = new htgs::TaskGraphConf<Data1, Data2>();
 * ...
 *
 * // If adding data to the TaskGraph, must use TaskGraph::setGraphConsumerTask
 * taskGraph->setGraphConsumerTask(someTask);
 *
 * // To receive data from the TaskGraph use  TaskGraph::addGraphOutputProducer
 * taskGraph->addGraphProducerTask(someOutputTask);
 *
 * htgs::TaskGraphRuntime *runtime = new htgs::TaskGraphRuntime(taskGraph);
 *
 * // Launch the runtime, will return after all threads have been configured for the taskGraph
 * runTime->executeRuntime();
 *
 * // Add data to the TaskGraph
 * for(int elem = 0 ; elem < numElems; elem++)
 *  taskGraph->produceData(new Data1(elem));
 *
 * // Indicate finished producing data
 * taskGraph->finishedProducingData();
 *
 * // Process the output until there is no more output to process
 * while(!taskGraph->isInputTerminated())
 * {
 *   std::shared_ptr<Data2> data = taskGraph->consumeData();
 *
 *   if (data != nullptr) {
 *     // Do post processing
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Wait for the Runtime to finish
 * runTime->waitForRuntime();
 * @endcode
 *
