/**
 * @class Bookkeeper Bookkeeper.hpp <htgs/api/Bookkeeper.hpp>
 * @brief Special task used to manage rules.
 * @details The Bookkeeper manages one or more rules, which customizes the flow of data within a task graph.
 * These rules specify a scheduling over input data. When data enters the Bookkeeper, each rule executes on that data
 * synchronously.
 *
 * To use the bookkeeper, create an IRule and an ITask. The IRule represents the rule that produces data
 * to the ITask. An edge is created with a RuleManager acting as the intermediary between the IRule and the ITask.
 * These RuleManagers are created automatically when adding the bookkeeper using the TaskGraphConf::addRuleEdge function.
 * Each RuleManager represents a different edge to another ITask connected to a Bookkeeper and have one
 * IRule connecting the ITask.
 *
 * If you wish to share an IRule with multiple Bookkeepers, you must wrap the IRule into a shared_ptr prior to
 * calling the TaskGraphConf::addRuleEdge function.
 *
 * 
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * htgs::TaskGraphConf<htgs::VoidData, htgs::VoidData> *tGraph = new htgs::TaskGraphConf<VoidData, VoidData>();
 *
 * htgs::Bookkeeper<MatrixData> *bk = new htgs::BookKeeper<MatrixData>();
 *
 * // ScalMultiplyTask has inputType: MultiMatrixData
 * ScalMultiplyTask *scalMul = new ScalMultiplyTask();
 *
 * // Submits data from bk to scalMul using rule MatrixRule. Only submits data if MatrixRule adds results
 * tGraph->addRuleEdge(bk, scalMul, new MatrixRule());
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam T the input data type for the Bookkeeper ITask, T must derive from IData.
 *
