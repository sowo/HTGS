 * @brief Implements the producer consumer edge that connects two tasks where one task is producing
 * data and the other is consuming.
 *
 * The edge is applied by getting the task managers for two ITasks and setting the output and
 * input connectors for the producer and consumer tasks to be the same, respectively.
 *
 * When the edge is copied the ITasks that represent the producer and consumer are retrieved
 * from the task graph that will become the copied graph.
 *
 * @tparam T the input type of the producer task
 * @tparam U the output type of the producer task and the input type of the consumer task
 * @tparam W the output type of the consumer task
