 * @class MemoryManager MemoryManager.hpp <htgs/core/memory/MemoryManager.hpp>
 * @brief Processes MemoryData between two ITasks using a memory pool.
 * @details
 * The memory pool is allocated using the IMemoryAllocator interface. As soon
 * as data is available in the pool, it is pushed to the ITask associated with the memory.
 *
 * The memoryPoolSize should be large enough to process the algorithm based on the release
 * rules added to the MemoryData when an ITask gets memory from a memory manager. These release rules should
 * be satisfied by the traversal of data that is specific to an algorithm and system memory capacity requirements.
 *
 * There are two types of memory managers:
 * (1) Static
 * (2) Dynamic
 *
 * Static memory managers allocate memory at initialization, and free memory using the destructor.
 *
 * Dynamic memory managers do not allocate memory. Memory allocation is moved to the ITask. Memory returned from an
 * ITask will be freed when the IMemoryRelease rule indicates the memory is ready to be released.
 *
 * @tparam T the input/output MemoryData type for the MemoryManager; i.e., double *
